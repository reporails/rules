# High-risk areas requiring extra caution
high_risk_areas:
  - capability-levels.md    # Central definitions - changes cascade
  - README.md              # Public-facing, scoring weights
  - core/**/*.md           # Rule definitions affect assessments

# Rule index by detection type
rule_index:
  deterministic:
    # 23 rules - OpenGrep pattern/structure detection
    - S1   # Size Limits (line count)
    - S4   # Hierarchical Memory (directory existence)
    - S5   # Path-Scoped Rules (YAML frontmatter)
    - S6   # YAML Backbone (file existence)
    - C4   # Anti-pattern Documentation (NEVER/AVOID count)
    - C5   # MUST/MUST NOT with Context (pattern detection)
    - C7   # Emphasis Discipline (IMPORTANT/CRITICAL count)
    - C9   # Has Project Description (first line check)
    - C10  # Has NEVER Statements (pattern + alternative)
    - C11  # Links Valid (path existence)
    - C12  # Has Version/Date (pattern match)
    - E3   # Purpose-Based File Reading (reading strategy keywords)
    - E4   # Memory Reference (memory instruction keywords)
    - E5   # Grep Efficiency (files_with_matches/head_limit keywords)
    - E6   # Code Block Line Limit (line count)
    - E7   # @import Count (pattern count)
    - M6   # Map Staleness Prevention (path validation)
    - M7   # Rule Snippet Length (line count)
    - G1   # Organization Policies (file existence)
    - G5   # Contract Registry (YAML structure)
    - G6   # Component-Contract Binding (YAML structure)
    - G7   # Architecture Tests (file existence)
    - G8   # Metrics and CI/CD (workflow file check)
  heuristic:
    # 17 rules - OpenGrep gate + LLM confirmation
    - S2   # Progressive Disclosure (may miss custom formats)
    - S3   # No Embedded Code Snippets (``` gate)
    - S7   # Clear Markdown Structure (orphan detection weak)
    - C1   # Core Sections (heading wording varies)
    - C2   # Explicit Over Implicit (inline code gate)
    - C3   # Context-Specific Content (false positives)
    - C6   # Single Source of Truth (cross-file similarity)
    - C8   # Instructions Over Philosophy (philosophy keywords gate)
    - E1   # Deterministic Tools for Style (false positives)
    - E2   # Session Start Ritual (ritual keywords gate)
    - M1   # Version Control (external refs gate)
    - M2   # Review Process (process-based)
    - M3   # Change Management (format varies)
    - M4   # No Conflicting Rules (cross-file)
    - M5   # Auto-Generated Content Review (quality unverifiable)
    - G2   # Team Governance Structure (format varies)
    - G4   # Ownership Assignment (format varies)
  semantic:
    # 1 rule requires full LLM judgment (no pattern gate)
    - G3   # Security Rules Ownership (needs organizational context)
  behavioral:
    # 1 rule - runtime behavior, not detectable from file content
    - E8   # Context Window Awareness (model's native tracking)
